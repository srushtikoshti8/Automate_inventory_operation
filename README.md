For this task, I created a solution for inventory management using stored procedures in a database. The goal was to automate key inventory operations, such as adding new products and updating existing stock levels. I started by defining a simple products table to store all the necessary information, including product name, stock quantity, and price. Next, I developed two primary stored procedures. The first, AddNewProduct, handles adding a new product to the inventory by taking the product's name, initial quantity, and price as inputs. The second, UpdateProductStock, manages changes to stock levels for an existing product; it accepts a product ID and a number to either add to or subtract from the current stock. Finally, I provided sample execution commands to demonstrate how to use these procedures
